    <div class="tools-container">

      <div class="tool-card">
        <img src="excel logo.png" alt="Excel">
        <h3>Excel</h3>
        <p>I offer expert Excel and Advanced Excel services including data cleaning and formatting by removing
          duplicates, fixing errors, and applying consistent structures to make datasets analysis-ready. I manage large
          datasets efficiently using features like tables, named ranges, data validation, drop-down lists, and
          conditional formatting. With a strong command of formulas and functions such as VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH,
          IF, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, and TEXT functions, I perform accurate and fast data analysis. I also create dynamic
          Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Charts to summarize complex data visually, and design interactive, professional
          dashboards that turn raw data into clear, actionable insights.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- <div class="tool-card">
      <img src="images/advanced-excel.png" alt="Advanced Excel">
      <h3>Advanced Excel</h3>
      <p>Enhanced Excel features like Power Query, Macros, VLOOKUP, and dashboards to manage and analyze big data efficiently.</p>
    </div> -->

      <div class="tool-card">
        <img src="mysql logo.png" alt="MySQL">
        <h3>MySQL</h3>
        <p>I specialize in database management by creating, maintaining, and organizing structured databases using MySQL
          to efficiently handle large volumes of data. I write powerful SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and sort data
          using key commands like SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY. By performing in-depth data analysis
          directly from databases, I uncover trends, generate insights, and support informed business decisions. I work
          seamlessly with JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) to combine data from multiple tables for
          comprehensive analysis. Additionally, I manage data import and export across formats like CSV and Excel, and
          generate custom SQL-based reports that highlight business metrics and KPIs in a clear and meaningful way.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tool-card">
        <img src="python logo.png" alt="Python">
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p> I leverage Python for efficient data analysis and processing using powerful libraries like Pandas and NumPy
          to clean, manipulate, and explore large datasets. I create insightful and interactive visualizations with
          Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to reveal patterns and trends in data. By automating repetitive tasks such as
          data cleaning, file handling, and report generation, I save time and minimize manual work. I work seamlessly
          with various file formats including CSV, Excel, and JSON, and also connect to APIs to collect real-time data
          for analysis. Additionally, I integrate Python with tools like MySQL and Excel to streamline data workflows,
          and have started working with basic machine learning models using Scikit-learn for simple prediction and
          classification tasks. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tool-card">
        <img src="power bi logo.png" alt="Power BI">
        <h3>Power BI</h3>
        <p>I use Power BI to transform raw data into meaningful insights by importing it from sources like Excel, MySQL, and more, then cleaning and modeling it using Power Query and DAX. I design interactive and visually engaging dashboards with filters, slicers, and KPIs to simplify complex data and support decision-making. By leveraging DAX functions, I calculate key metrics, track performance, and uncover hidden trends. I also create customized reports tailored to specific business needs such as sales analysis, customer behavior, or financial performance. To ensure accessibility and accuracy, I enable auto-refresh and cloud sharing, and build live dashboards for real-time data monitoring, allowing businesses to act on insights instantly.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tool-card">
        <img src="chatgpt.png" alt="ChatGPT">
        <h3>ChatGPT</h3>
        <p>I integrate AI tools like ChatGPT into my data analytics workflow to enhance speed, accuracy, and productivity. I use ChatGPT to generate quick data summaries, explanations, and actionable insights that support faster decision-making. It also assists me in creating professional reports, project documentation, emails, and content writing—saving time while maintaining high quality. When working with data, I rely on ChatGPT to troubleshoot errors, explore complex concepts, and improve code in Python or SQL. I also automate various text-based tasks such as formatting, rewriting, formula creation, and code generation. As a virtual assistant, ChatGPT helps me brainstorm ideas, solve problems, and streamline my workflow in every stage of a data project.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tool-card">
        <img src="gemini logo.png" alt="Gemini AI">
        <h3>Gemini AI</h3>
        <p>I leverage Gemini AI to enhance my data analytics projects through smart research and insights, quickly summarizing large volumes of data and identifying key trends. It helps me generate clear, concise summaries and reports that make complex information accessible to non-technical stakeholders. I use Gemini AI for intelligent assistance in tasks such as code suggestions, formula generation, and automating repetitive work across Excel, SQL, and Python. By simulating "what-if" scenarios and generating smart recommendations, Gemini AI plays a key role in supporting business decision-making. Overall, it boosts my productivity by saving time, increasing accuracy, and accelerating project delivery in a seamless and efficient way.</p>
